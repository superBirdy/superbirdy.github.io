summary:Forecasting National Level Electricity Mix Based on Planned Installed Capacity: A Machine Learning and Multinomial Logit Modeling Approach
abstract: 'National level electricity generation is difficult to forecast due to multiple factors, such as the complexity of energy system, changes of policy, economic factors, technology advances, and intermittency of renewable energy sources. In recent years, the energy sector has witnessed a significant shift towards renewable energy sources, prompting the need for accurate forecasting of power mix compositions at the national level. Clustering similar power mix profiles among countries is difficult using econometric tools which rely on assumptions about the structure of the data. Traditional clustering is based on income and major power generation technologies, and the results show little correlation between price and demand for about half of the countries.  Our previous work, which focused on econometric modeling only, indicates that over 50% of the countries did not perform well in forecasting. However, we will show that machine learning methods can be used to tease out the similarity of countries without strict assumptions. This study proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning techniques for clustering countries based on their energy profiles and policy factors and then utilizes Multinomial Logit (MNL) models for power mix forecasting.
