## About Me

Howdy~I‚Äôm an associate research scientist of Agricultural Economics at Texas A&M University. My research primarily centers on energy and environmental economics, agricultural economics, and climate change economics, with a particular emphasis on developing sustainable systems for energy and agriculture. I focus on understanding the economic and policy-driven mechanisms that underpin climate change economics, energy transitions, and sustainable agricultural practices. By employing advanced quantitative modeling techniques such as mathematical programming-based optimization models and econometric analysis, I analyze the economic feasibility and environmental impact of various energy systems, agricultural practices, and mitigation strategies.

In addition to modeling and policy analysis, I apply life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) methodologies to evaluate the full environmental and economic costs of emerging technologies and practices. These assessments help identify opportunities for improving sustainability, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing resilience to climate impacts.
